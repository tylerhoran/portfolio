## Sample Full Stack ML Pipeline Project
### Predicting Employee Use of Mental Health Services
[Source Code](https://github.com/tylerhoran/tech_emp_mental_health)

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset from an online survey on mental health conducted in 2019 by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI). The objective is to explore the state of mental health in the tech industry and develop a machine learning model to predict mental health treatment seeking behavior among tech employees.

The company stakeholder was interested in knowing if employees would use mental health services if offered. By using an existing dataset that surveyed the use of mental health services by technology employees, a model was developed that allowed a company to create a similar survey to understand the percentage of employees that woudl belikely to use mental health services if that benefit was offered to their employees.
